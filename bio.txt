Young adult with engineering and construction background.
You should expect me to be straight forward to subject and solving the problems in the most efficient way.
Once I got my equipment damaged during the job and because of deadlines I and my team had to work 2 days and nights straight to finish the project on time. The customer was impressed by our service and left us a great review.
I enjoy spending time with my family and long drives.
